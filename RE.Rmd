  <h2>2.2.1. English Abstract Short Version</h2>
  <p>
Introduction: Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are linked to changes in microRNA (miRNA) expression, affecting gene expression and various biological processes. This study aims to explore miRNAs associated with PAH exposure in a generally healthy community population, seeking to understand the potential health effects and biological mechanisms involved.

Methods: In the Shiyan community, 160 participants were studied, measuring urinary monohydroxy PAHs and plasma benzo[a]pyrene-diol-epoxide adducts as PAH exposure biomarkers. Plasma miRNA levels were quantified using RNA sequencing, with relationships assessed via multivariable linear regression. Stratified and interaction analyses considered factors like age, sex, BMI, and smoking status. Candidate target genes for identified miRNAs were explored using several databases, with gene function enrichment analyzed via the DAVID database.

Results: Significant associations were found between specific PAH metabolites and 42 miRNAs, with four showing strong connections under more rigorous criteria. Stratified analyses highlighted age, smoking status, and BMI as influential factors in these relationships. Target gene functions for these miRNAs were linked to several critical biological processes and diseases, indicating broad systemic effects.

Conclusions: This study identified specific miRNAs significantly associated with PAH exposure in a generally healthy community, implicating these miRNAs in potentially mediating health impacts like cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and immune responses. These findings suggest that miRNAs could be crucial in the body's response to environmental toxins.

- Student Researcher & Program Leader, 04/2020-04/2022  

- Supervisor: Professor Chaolong Wang, Professor and Deputy Dean, Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, School of Public Health, Huazhong University of Science and Technology

- This funded provincial Undergraduate Training Program in Innovation and Entrepreneurship was initiated and led by me, in collaboration with four classmates under the guidance of Professor Chaolong Wang.

- My responsibilities included organizing and analyzing genome-wide association studies data from 700,000 individuals in the UK Biobank and Million Veteran Program using R. I conducted bidirectional Mendelian randomization analysis to investigate the causal relationship between insomnia and major depressive disorder.

- Resulted in a first-author publication. Professor Xingjie Hao served as the corresponding author and the advisor throughout the writing and publication process.
